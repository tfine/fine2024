      <main>
        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold my-4">Smart Contract with America!</h1>
        <p class="my-2">
          The FINE 2024 campaign's Smart Contract presents our top priorities
          and goals for our administration, but we will pursue other initiatives
          as well. Please contact us with your ideas!
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Crypto Taxes</h2>
        <p class="my-2">
          Our administration will place an immediate moratorium on crypto taxes
          pending an overall reform of the U.S. tax code.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">AI Dividend</h2>
        <p class="my-4">
          We must ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed among the
          American people, who financed the basic research and education that
          led to the computing revolution.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Political Corruption</h2>
        <p class="my-4">
          The Republican and Democratic parties have abused our election laws
          and congressional procedures to block competition and prevent
          legislation demanded by the American people. Academic studies show
          that nearly all legislation reflects the desires of a small elite
          rather than the interests of voters. We will coordinate a political
          reform commission to prepare for a Constitutional Convention to
          correct these abuses.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Income Inequality</h2>
        <p class="my-4">
          Our administration will pursue wealth taxes, luxury taxes, and
          anti-tax haven rules to ensure that the wealthy contribute to the
          proper functioning of the state. In turn, we will try to simplify the
          tax code for everyone going forward.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Debt Jubilee</h2>
        <p class="my-4">
          Out-of-control levels of debt exist in finance, medical care, housing,
          education, and consumer credit. Our administration will pursue a “New
          Deal” that works to forgive large quantities of debt across the board.
          Much of this jubilee will be financed by the AI dividend and new forms
          of energy production. The United States will negotiate with
          international partners and coordinate an international jubilee of
          national debt in conjunction with these domestic reforms.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Drug Offenders</h2>
        <p class="my-4">
          We will pursue the mass pardoning of nonviolent drug offenders, which
          will reduce expenses for prison maintenance and give many tortured
          souls a second chance at life. Improving economic conditions and
          providing hope are necessary to reduce overall demands for illegal
          drugs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          We will establish a new national housing agenda that encourages the
          rapid development of new housing through new paradigms of construction
          technology and economies of scale. We will also invest in public
          transportation to enable more efficient and healthy cities.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Water</h2>
        <p class="my-4">
          We will pursue new energy technologies that allow for the
          desalinization of ocean water, as well as invest in new pipes and
          infrastructure for water treatment and distribution across the nation.
          A National Water Investment Act will be one of our first priorities.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Ecological Corridors</h2>
        <p class="my-4">
          The future of our planet is at stake from runaway climate change. We
          will urgently work with all world nations to establish linked
          ecological corridors that will allow for biodiversity to revive, as we
          face the unprecedented threat of accelerated climate change and
          chemical pollution.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Immigration</h2>
        <p class="my-4">
          The immigration crisis is fueled by corporations and businesses who
          wish to import people for work with substandard wages and poor
          conditions. We should control the border but also ensure reform of our
          legal immigration system. The United States must further ensure that
          immigrants assimilate as Americans through a revival of attention to
          American traditions and American culture.
